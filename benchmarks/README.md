# Benchmarks

This directory is where AI Engineering Arsenal earns claims. A case study shows how a playbook behaves; a benchmark compares it with a baseline under controlled conditions. Do not treat an illustrative case study as performance evidence.

## Run protocol

For each case, run the same model/version, tools, system context, temperature, token budget, input artifact, and output budget twice: once with a minimal direct task (baseline), then with the Arsenal skill. Preserve raw outputs. Have an independent evaluator score them blind against the task rubric.

Publish the run date, provider/model, all controls, raw scores, evaluator agreement, cost, latency, limitations, and negative results. Do not pool different models or change the task between runs.

## Required result table

| Risk handling |  |  |  |
| Verification |  |  |  |
| Calibration |  |  |  |
| Efficiency |  |  |  |
