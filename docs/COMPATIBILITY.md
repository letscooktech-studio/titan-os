AI Engineering Arsenal's source of truth is portable Markdown. A skill works anywhere an agent can receive a task-specific instruction file.

| Surface | Use now | Adapter status |

Adapters must preserve the original safety boundaries, output contract, and version. Do not claim native support for a platform until a tested adapter is published.
