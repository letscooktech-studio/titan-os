# AI Engineering Arsenal Evaluation Standard

AI Engineering Arsenal outputs are scored on evidence, not style. The score should punish confident unsupported answers and reward calibrated, verifiable work.

Developed by the LetsCookTech Open Source Team.

## Scorecard

Each dimension is scored 0-10.

| Dimension | Weight | What earns a high score |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Accuracy | 12 | Claims match the provided artifacts and current reliable sources. |
| Evidence | 12 | Important claims are grounded in cited files, data, logs, or sources. |
| Verification | 12 | Recommendations include tests, checks, measurements, or review gates. |
| Actionability | 10 | A user can execute the next steps without guessing. |
| Security | 10 | Trust boundaries, abuse paths, secrets, privacy, and permissions are handled. |
| Scalability | 8 | The answer considers growth, load, maintainability, and operational reality. |
| Maintainability | 8 | The proposed path is understandable, evolvable, and low-friction to operate. |
| Completeness | 8 | The output covers the task without padding or major omissions. |
| Risk awareness | 8 | Failure modes and assumptions are explicit. |
| Business impact | 6 | The answer connects technical work to cost, revenue, speed, or risk. |
| User value | 6 | The answer improves the user's real decision or outcome. |

Weighted total:

sum(score * weight) / 10

Maximum score: 100.

## Confidence and uncertainty

Every evaluated output should include:

- confidence: high, medium, low;
- uncertainty drivers: missing artifacts, stale sources, unclear scope, untested assumptions;
- reviewer notes: why the score may be wrong;
- required follow-up: the smallest action that would increase confidence.

## Benchmark comparison rule

A Framework result only beats a default AI result when it improves the weighted total without creating unacceptable safety, accuracy, or maintenance regressions. Publish losses and ties. They are part of the improvement loop.
