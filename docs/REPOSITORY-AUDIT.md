# AI Engineering Arsenal repository audit

This audit converts the repository from a collection of playbooks into a trust system. The core risk is not that AI Engineering Arsenal has too few skills. The risk is that it publishes impressive text without proving repeatable value.

Developed by the LetsCookTech Open Source Team.

## Asset audit

| Area | Purpose | Target user | Usage frequency | Measurable value | Maintenance cost | Redundancy risk | Improvement priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `skills/` | Portable AI operating playbooks | Founders, engineers, CTOs, AI builders | High when solving recurring decisions | Better decisions, fewer missed risks, clearer outputs | Medium | High if skills become generic prompts | Keep only skills with a benchmark path |
| `benchmarks/` | Rubrics and comparison protocol | Evaluators, maintainers, skeptical users | Medium | Evidence of improvement vs default AI | Medium | Low | Add runnable baseline/Framework result pairs |
| `case-studies/` | Demonstrations of output quality | New users, launch audiences | High during evaluation | Faster trust formation | Medium | Medium if synthetic examples look like marketing | Label synthetic vs real and publish raw inputs |
| `evals/` | Versioned task fixtures | Contributors, maintainers | Medium | Reproducibility | Medium | Low | Add expected risk inventory and scorer bindings |
| `docs/` | Standards, positioning, operating rules | Maintainers, contributors, advanced users | Medium | Consistency and onboarding | Medium | Medium | Link every standard to validation |
| `.github/` | Community and CI flow | Contributors | Medium | Safer contributions | Low | Low | Add benchmark submission issue template later |
| `scripts/` | Deterministic checks | Maintainers | High before release | Prevents structural decay | Low | Low | Add scoring utilities and proof-pack checks |

## Critical weaknesses

1. AI Engineering Arsenal still has more standards than public proof. Users trust results, not promises.
2. Several skills are useful but not yet surrounded by runnable benchmark artifacts.
3. The repo can look like a prompt repository unless README, examples, and benchmarks keep emphasizing measured outcomes.
4. Market research is directional, not continuously refreshed with live star counts and competitor release changes.
5. Case studies are synthetic demonstrations. That is acceptable only if clearly labeled and followed by real audits.

## Missing systems

- A single evaluation standard applied across all skills.
- A red-team checklist that attacks outputs before publication.
- Proof-pack templates so every skill evolves the same way.
- A release gate that blocks unbenchmarked claims.
- A benchmark ledger showing baseline output, Framework output, evaluator score, and known limitations.

## AI-generated filler detection

Flag content for deletion or rewrite when it:

- uses roleplay language without changing the work product;
- claims superiority without a reproducible comparison;
- adds a framework without an input, output, check, and failure mode;
- repeats generic advice that a default assistant would already know;
- creates new skill names instead of improving proof for tier-one skills.

## Deletions before additions

Before adding a new skill, remove or rewrite any existing skill that lacks:

1. a recurring user problem;
2. required input;
3. an evidence standard;
4. explicit failure detection;
5. a benchmark or planned benchmark;
6. a concrete output contract.

## Next proof priorities

1. Create baseline and AI Engineering Arsenal outputs for `security-auditor` using `evals/security-auditor/ordinary`.
2. Add expected-risk inventories to all tier-one evals.
3. Score outputs with the AI Engineering Arsenal Evaluation Standard.
4. Publish a transparent comparison table even when AI Engineering Arsenal loses on a dimension.
5. Use real public demo apps only when authorization and license boundaries are clean.
